Dataset generation
The dataset for populating the search engine is generated by crawling the
seed url `http://www.hindilyrics.net/lyrics/' .A recursive method of crawling
is used to extract each of the unique lyrics pages starting from the given seed
url.The following elds are extracted from each webpage.
 Page title
 url
 Movie
 Song title
 Singer(s)
 Music by
 Lyricist(s)
 Lyrics
 Metadata
The crawled data is stored into SolrDocument with the eld values matching
those specied in the schema.xml le. Each such document corresponding to a
lyrics page is then added to the server. Jsoup libraries are used for crawling the
pages.
