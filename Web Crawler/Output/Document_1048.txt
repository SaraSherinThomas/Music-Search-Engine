 Sabra ki meethi chashni mein bhigoke Waqt khada hai martabaan mein leke Le chakh le yeh murabba - 2 Dil mein rakh le yeh murabba Dil mein rakh le rakh le Yeh murabba  Zindagi zindagi Jaisi iski zaat hai zaat hai Jitni zyada umar hai baat hai Beetke jitne mausam choo gaye Utne iske seene mein juzbaat hai Kal se zyada Aaj turr lagta hai turr lagta hai Kal phir khaana behtar lagta hai  Le chakh le yeh murabba mausam mausam jua hua Tujh tak aaya hai yeh le chakh le yeh muraaba Musam ki kadar naahi ohka surmaya hai Dil mein rakh le yeh murabba Hmm..dil mein rakh le rakh le Yeh murabba Rakh le rakh le yeh murabba Murabba murabba
