 The ma the ma the ma the mam the man man man The man gotta the man gotaa goin on Keep the body going to break a dawn Got the ones and the phonies full em with shorties Given them the every little thing they want He given them the every little thing they want (Make a wish, make a wish And i will make your wish come true Puri kar dunga pal bhar mein teri har khwaaish-o-aaraju) - (2) Jannat rakh du main teri kadamon mein, all you gotta do is say Jeet jaayega tu har baaji, all you gotta do is play (Aladin give me ye taali taali, sun tera bheja hai khaali Tujhase aake kismat hai gale milane waali) - (2) I do the grooves the whole world moves Aaja tu bhi mere taal pe naach le I do the grooves and you gotta to move Chhod tu karana bahaane aaj se I do it like this, i do it like that I wanna them at decks and the beats don' t stop and the base is fat The man gotta going gotta going on Keep the body going to break a dawn Got the ones and the phonies full em with shorties Given them the every little thing they want (Aladin give me ye taali taali, sun tera bheja hai khaali Tujhase aake kismat (hai gale milane waali -3)) - (2) I got the rocks, i got the ride I got the hotties by my side I got the moves and i got game You can get close but it aint the same When i say hey ma ma, i gotta shorties jumpin I wanna be the don boom boom, got the part pumpin Like this, bom biri bom biri biri bom bom biri bom biri bom bom (Aladin give me ye taali taali, sun tera bheja hai khaali Tujhase aake kismat (hai gale milane waali -3)) - (2) Make a wish
