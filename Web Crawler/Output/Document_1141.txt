 Tedhe mere raaston ko seedha main bana doon Mujhe jo sikhaane aaye usse main sikha doon Who the hell are you to tell me what to do You better not mess with me Mere dil mein jo aaye woh main karoon You better not mess with me Mere dil mein aaye jo mein karu Kisi se bhi aakhir haan main kyun daroon Just leave me alone i wanna be on my own Kyun chhup rahuin main kyun sab sahuin  Jo bhi chaha na mila toh maine usse china Keh diya toh dil mein aaya, honthon ko kya seena Who the hell are you to tell me what to do Mujhe hai pasand bas isse tarah jeena Better not mess with me Mere dil mein aaye jo mein karu Kisi se bhi aakhir haan main kyun daroon Just leave me alone i wanna be on my own Kyun chhup rahuin main kyun sab sahuin  Khuda hai aasma jisme main bandh hoon Apne bas mein nahin lekin bas mein hi hoon Mere andhar mere andhar, ek tufan hai Mere andhar mere andhar, har subah shaam hai.. Jo bhi chaha na mila toh maine usse china Keh diya toh dil mein aaya, honthon ko kya sina Who the hell are you to tell me what to do Mujhe hai bas issi tarah jina Better not mess with me Mere dil mein jo woh main karoon You better not mess with me Kisi se bhi aakhir haan main kyun daroon Just leave me alone i wanna be on my own Kyun chhup rahuin main kyun sab sahuin
