 Jab woh hamase puchha karenge Tab hum unase yahi kahenge Jab woh (jab woh) hamse (hamase) puchha karenge Tab hum (tab hum) unase (unase) yahi kahenge  Ke waqt uss naam se hi jaana jaayega Yeh waqt uss shaks ka hi to kehlaayega Suna suna jag saara, suna suna tere bina  We lived in his world, we lived in his time He was the sound of our music , and our lives Na hoga koi, phir aisa kahin He was the sound of our music, and our lives  Never never never never be another Never never never never be another Never never never never be another  Never never never never be another Never never never never be another  Raahe huyi suni suni si, ki har ek lamha nam hai, nam hai Subah mein roshani kam hai, sur ho gaye khaali khaali se Ki har ek lamaha nam hai, nam hai Subah mein roshani kam hai Yaad rahega hamesha woh, sangeet ko aawaaz de gaya  We lived in his world, we lived in his time He was the sound of our music and our lives Na hoga koi phir aisa kahin He was the sound of our music and our lives  We lived in his world (na hoga koi) We lived in his time (phir aisa kahin) He was the sound of our music and our lives  We lived in his world, we lived in his time (We lived in his time) He was the sound of our music  Now its hard to say good bye
