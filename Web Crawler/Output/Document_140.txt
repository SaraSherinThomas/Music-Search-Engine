 (Iss me hai chamak is me hai nasha Iss me chhahte is me hai wafa) - 2 Dhoka hai jara sa jara nafrate Chhod rahe wafa jab huye bewafa Is me hai chamak is me hai nasha Is me chhahte is me hai wafa  Koi rahe pyasa koi jham ke piye Hum iskeliye kya nahi hai kiye Is ki khatir mare is ki khatir jiye Kyu khe ye duniya hai ye sada ke liye Iss me hai chamak is me hai nasha Iss me chhahte is me hai wafa  Thode se aarma thodi khwaise Thoda sa hak thodi farmaise Baag hatho me hai Angare dil me bhi hai wisati nahi phir bhi Hoti rahe barise (Iss me hai chamak is me hai nasha Iss me chhahte is me hai wafa) - 2
