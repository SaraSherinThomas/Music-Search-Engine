 Ho puranvadan punavidhan puranatur lakhshayate Puranshay puranvadaya purname pachisayate Om shanti shanti shanti  Dams will stole love dams will take heart Dams will stole hopes dams will told emmotions Never fall dams weapining for wings streams Never let friendship dam in his depth Dams of trust dams of stress Dams of watch and dams of love Have you ever lost love to feel its pain You know mind ways could be fells Love this is no dream without felling you Has a dropper on the way but not run a half Fatch way to leave temrature love is fast Hey drink but knowing the true Lost in the seewithout say let sports Swing of the wigjot obriquick with love  To let he want to read your mind I am still ablazing that let know love But not is challange widjot india love (Dams will stole love dams will take heart Dams will stole hopes dams will told emmotions) - 2
