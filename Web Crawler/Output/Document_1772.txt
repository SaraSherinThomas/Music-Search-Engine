 Ishka ishka allah hu, luke na mushka allah hu  Chhanwe chhanwe yeh parachhanwe, chunate chunate chalate rahiye Mom ke jame pahane pahane, dhup lage toh galate rahiye  Chhanwe chhanwe apne hi parachhanwe chunate chalate rahiye Mom ke jame pahane pahane dhup lage toh galate rahiye  Ishk khile jab ishk khile, tan bartan me bhar jawe khushabu  Ambar ke charakhe kee ghu ghu, sunate rahana Tage chunake khalee karagha bunate rahana  Sar pe chalate ambar ke charakhe kee ghu ghu sunate rahana Kachche pakke tage chunake khalee karagha bunate rahana  Rat kee rat hai sab yara, din ughade phir na mai na too
