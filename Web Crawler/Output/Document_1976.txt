 Bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo Door adnheri kheti se ek roshani muskuraayi So gayi raat koyi aake suraj ko jagaaye Ik nayi aas leke ik naya sabera aaya Kahin dur se jaise koyi aake gungunaaya Bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo Baiyaan pasaare mithe dhoop ki dekho aayo sabera ?? Dekho dekho suraj re baaki chale ??? Bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo  Saara aasmaan yeh kyun naya sa lag raha Jaise ki kishton mein yeh sawera jag raha Badhake har kadam mein khwaaishon ki aahate Subah ki baahon mein din hai leta karwate Bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo Baiyaan pasaare mithe dhoop ki dekho aayo sabera ?? Dekho dekho suraj re baaki chale ??? Bhor bhayo, bhor bhayo
