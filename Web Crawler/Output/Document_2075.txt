 Ur lov is like a star shining in my heart Lighting up my life it' s true girl Never felt this way before, i keep wanting it more and more What would i be without u girl U hav shown me the lov i hav never seen U are like an angel from my sweetest dream U hav given me my world, i couldn'  t find o my own girl Now i know what lov is Meri saanso se tere pyaar ki khushabu aaye Tere aane se mere dil pe nikhaar aa jaye Dil ko tune jo chhuwa, aisa mehsus huwa Jaise sehara mein bhi bhule se ghata chha jaaye Tera mera pyaar sanam, waada hai kabhi hoga na kam Banake dhadkan tu meri jaanam, base dil mein mere Oh my, my oh my I never wanna hear u say gud bye How much u mean to me i realise, realise Come near baby come close I am not ever gonna let u go How much u mean to me, do u know U hav shown me da lov i hav never seen U are like an angel from my sweetest dream U hav given me my world, i couldn'  t find o my own girl Now i know what lov is (Tera mera pyaar sanam, waada hai kabhi hoga na kam Banake dhadkan tu meri jaanam, base dil mein mere) - (2) Tera mera pyaar Oh my, my oh my I never wanna hear u say gud bye How much u mean to me i realise, realise
