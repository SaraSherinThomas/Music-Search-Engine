 Yeah oh right Kya maine socha aur kya huwa Kya dil ne chaha aur kya mila Ab jeet kaisi aur haar kya Kispe bharosa aitbaar kya Phir bhi dil me aas hai Aankho me talash hai Tum jo saath ho ik subah aayegi Roshni jo layegi ho Ab ki jo raat ho  One love har tan kahe One love mil kar rahe One love ik aasman ha ik jaha One love naya josh hai One love nayi soch hai One love hame hai yakin One love is all we need  It's late at night i am still wide awake Babe this is far more than i can take I got my eyes closed never pray Now i know that's one big mistake  I refuse to give up i refuse to give in Ho uh huh you're my everythin' I don't wanna give up i don't wanna give in Oh no everybody stay  One love for the mother's pride One love for the times we cried One love got to stay alive i will survive One love for the city streets One love for the hip hop beats One love for i do believe One night is all we need That's right Baby just love me love me love me Baby just hold me hold me hold me Oh love me love me love me  Aa One love baby just love me love me love me Just hold me hold me hold me Oh love me love me love me  Aa aa One love for the mother's pride One love for the times we cried One love got to stay alive i will survive One love for the city streets One love for the hip hop beats One love oh i do believe One love is all we need One love dhadkan kahe One love milkar rahe One love ek aasman ha ik jaha One love naya josh hai One love nayi soch hai One love hamein hai yakin One love is all we need
