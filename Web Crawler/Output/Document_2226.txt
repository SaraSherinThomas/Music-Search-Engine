 Tune apana farj nibhaaya, yuun mamata ka karj chukaaya Duniya ko di ik kahaani, maa ka matlab hai kurbaani Teri chita par aaj farishtein aakar phul chdhaaye Maayein, pyaar ki ghataayein hmm mm mm... Thandi thandi hawaayein, maayein, pyaar ki ghataayein Apane ghar, apane bachchon ke liye jiye mar jaaye Maayein, pyaar ki ghataayein Thandi thandi hawaayein, maayein, pyaar ki ghataayein Pyaar ki ghataayein, pyaar ki ghataayein
