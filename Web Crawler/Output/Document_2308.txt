 Dil ke is ghar mein aake ek ladki Chupke chupke thake ek ladki Are are are o Are are are o  Jaan ke sab kuch ek ladki Bol na kyun kuch ek ladki Phir bhi kabhi tu manegi yeh Are are are o Are are are o  Wo chup rehti hai Par hume khabre milti hai Tab kya hota hai Jab ye nazrein milti hai Are are are o Thoda laga ke mann seekhe zara Itni khatin bhi Na dil ki zubaan hum ye manisha ye Itni si baat hai uske bin kaali din Kaali yeh raat hai aaj kal Wo chup rehti hai par hume khabre milti hai Tab kya hota hai jab ye nazrein milti hai  Khwahish ki mitti mein rang khile Neendon mein aksar hai Khwab chalen hum ye manisha ye Kuch na socha kuch na jaana Ishq humko ho gaya aa Wo chup rehti hai par hume khabre milti hai Tab kya hota hai jab ye nazrein milti hai
