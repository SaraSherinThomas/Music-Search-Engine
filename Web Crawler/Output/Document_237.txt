 I am in love, you are in love He is in love, she is in love  Koyi hai aashiq, koyi mahabub hai Yeh duniya kub hai - (2) I am in love  Kahi pe romiyo-juliyat, kahi raanjha, kahi heer Kahi shiri-farahad yeh nam sabko hai yad Sabke bahane dil se manasub hain, yeh duniya kub hai  Kitne hain mausam lekin yeh rut hai ek suhani Baraso ki jindgani me do din ki hai jawani Aur yeh jawani dil se manasub hai Yeh duniya kub hai
