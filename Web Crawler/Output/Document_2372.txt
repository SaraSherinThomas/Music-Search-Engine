 Dhoom dhoom come and light my fire Dhoom dhoom let me take u higher Dhoom dhoom wanna feel that burning Dhoom dhoom it' s a wild emotion Dhoom dhoom passion and devotion Dhoom dhoom now the wheels are turning Muv ur body close to mine now Let me feel ur luv divine now 2gether we will explode and we will go boom boom boom boom Dhoom machale, dhoom machale dhoom - (4)  Dhoom dhoom m gonna make u sweat now Dhoom dhoom let' s get all wet now Dhoom dhoom gotta get down on it Dhoom dhoom till the early morning Dhoom dhoom until the dawning Dhoom dhoom i know dat u want it Shake ur body down to the ground Once u go there is no turning round Tonight we gonna make the world go boom boom boom boom Dhoom machale, dhoom machale dhoom - (4)  This burning inside u, know u just cannot hide So don' t fight the feeling just let ur body decide Where u get down on the road, it' s a wild overload Riding higher than u ever did before Dhoom dhoom let ur body do the talking Dhoom dhoom i wanna keep on rocking Dhoom dhoom i want it 24*7 Dhoom dhoom get the rhythm of the beat now Dhoom dhoom feel the fire and the heat now Dhoom dhoom take a trip toh heaven I wanna feel the wind inn my hair now Spread the power everywhere now Feel the magic just go jip jap jum Dhoom machale Dhoom machale, dhoom machale dhoom - (4)
