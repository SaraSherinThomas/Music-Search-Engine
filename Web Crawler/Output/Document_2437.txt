 Yamma yamma yamma yamma, yeh khubsurat sama - (2) Bas aaj kee rat hai jindagee, kal ham kahan tum kaha - (2)  Kab kya ho jaye kisko khaber, aa nachle jhumkar Yeh jindagee ek lamba safar, pal bhar ke sab ham safar Ek rat ke mehman sab yaha, kal ham kahan tum kaha Haste huwe aisee shan se, divane jal jayenge  Are jalatee shama se milke gale, parwane jal jayenge Reh jayga yado kaa diya, kal ham kaha tum kaha Yamma yamma yamma yamma, yeh khubsurat sama Bas aaj kee rat hai jindagee, kal ham kahan tum kaha - (2)
