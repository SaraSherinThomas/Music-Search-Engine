 U better put this up ahh right now (One for the treeble, two for the base King is the place, u better watch this phase) - (4) Put ur wrist up...... Hey ek color ke tera patte, lekin sab mein bas ek king Ace bhi hum hai, base bhi hum hai, aur jigar mein hai daring Now now....... Hey ek color ke tera patte, lekin sab mein bas ek king Ace bhi hum hai, base bhi hum hai, aur jigar mein hai daring Hum, hum kare dil ki jo marji, karte karte had kar di Dil agar saccha ho rab sab karde setting Singh is king, singh is king, singh is king - (4) Yo yo yo.. you know we bring da rockers in the place Dont be messing with me punkers, i hit in u in da face You know u better salute to the king You know u better back down to singh Chak de phaate cos we are the greatest Kabhi na darte cos we are da bravest Nachde haste bad as hell Punjbai in da house you better watch ur self Ek nahi dus dus bari, jeetlo jee duniya saari Dil kisika jo agar tum jeeto phir to ki gal hai Daag lo dus banduke, koyale phir bhi kunke Gal samjha pao unji boli to phir to ki gal hai Aao dil ka raag sunaao, o o o gao apna gana morning to evening Singh is king, singh is king, singh is king - (4) Yo better pump it up Singh is in da house u better turn it up I say better pump it up Singh is in da house u better turn it up (When i say singh, you say king Singh is king, singh is king) - (2) Shan thi na shan-o-shukat, na na na thi koyi shoharat Ek din mein hi khula kaise yeh kismat ka taala Na to mera kal tha kuchh bhi, na to mera abb hai kuchh bhi Ek bas dil tha abb toh woh bhi kisiko de daala Jeena ishq bina kya jeena, o o o jeena aise jeena unchi ho thinking Singh is king, singh is king, singh is king - (4)  Hey ek color ke tera patte, lekin sab mein bas ek king Ace bhi hum hai, base bhi hum hai, aur jigar mein hai daring Hum, hum kare dil ki jo marji, karte karte had kar di Dil agar saccha ho rab sab karde setting Singh is king, singh is king, singh is king - (4)
