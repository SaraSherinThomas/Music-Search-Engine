 Mukhtasar mulaqat hai ankahi koi baat hai Phir raat ki shaitaniyaan yaa alag yeh jazbat hain Mukhtasar mulaqat hai ankahi koi baat hai Ankahi koi baat hai Mukhtasar mulaqat hai ankahi koi baat hai Phir raat ki shaitaniyaan yaa alag yeh jazbat hai  I can't control this feeling don't know whats going on But i wanna let go oo woo  Mausam yeh kehta hai bheege andhero'n mein Dubki lagate hain aa par mujhko lagta hai Main rok loon khud ko ehsaas hai yeh naya Kya hua main hoon bekhabar hai naya saa suhana asar Jeet hai ya maat hai mukhtasar mulakat hai Ankahi koi baat hai  Yeh toh suna tha ke kuch aisa hota hai Par mujhko bhi ho gaya meri toh duniya bilkul alag thi Andaaz woh kho gaya dekhna doobna ho gaya Doobna tairna ho gaya kya asar mere saath hai Mukhtasar mulaqat hai ankahi koi baat hai Phir raat ki shaitaniyaan ya alag yeh jazbat hai
