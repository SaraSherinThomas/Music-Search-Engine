 Baby i can si the sun rising in your eyes Baby everytime i think of you you make me smile Baby i' ll be your every dream and you should know Baby i' ll never ever wanna let you go Baby  (Zindagi ki nindhon ki subah ishq hai.. baby Badi khubsurat si saza ishq hai.. Humko pyar hua hai puri huai dua - 2) - 2 Chal chal kahin udke hum chal kahin Aasma ishq hai khwaishon sa khula hai Mujhko chu gaya ek ehsaas anchhua Jaise koi nasha aasma mein ghula hai Pyar hua humko pyar hua puri hua dua Humko pyar hua hai puri huai dua - 2 Baby i can si the sun rising in your eyes Baby everytime i think of you you make me smile Baby i' ll be your every dream and you should know Baby i' ll never ever wanna let you go Khawaabon mein kabhi maine socha tha nahin Chahaton ka khuda mujhko etne yun dega Befikar chala apni yeh dagar chala Kya pata tha ke dil teri khaatir rukega Pyar hua humko pyar hua puri huai dua Humko pyar hua hai puri huai dua - 2  Kahe mujhse ye mara ye rasta hai Kyun na jara sa tu bhatakatha hai Ab to hai nayab ye safar Jara kaho to meri majil se Dikhe ye meri rahe sahil se Tu he to ye khab ye safar  Kahin dil ne thodi se beemanniya  Di hai khubsoorat si pareshaniya Humko pyaar hua puri hua dua - 2  Chal chal kahin udke hum chal kahin Aasma ishq hai khwaishon sa khula hai Mujhko chu gaya ek ehsaas anchhua Jaise koi nasha aasma mein ghoola hai Pyaar hua humko pyaar hua puri hua dua Humko pyaar hua puri hua dua - 2 Baby i can si the sun rising in your eyes Baby everytime i think of you you make me smile Baby i' ll be your every dream and you should know Baby i' ll never ever wanna let you go
