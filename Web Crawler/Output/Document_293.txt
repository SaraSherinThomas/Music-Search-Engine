 Ye mausam aaya hai kitne salo me Aaja kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Aaja ki kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Kaliyo ke chehre nikhar gaye hai Phulo ke sehre bikhar gaye hai  Sab kushbu bas gayi hai In reshami shabanami balo me Aaja kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Aaja ki kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Aankho ka milana kub raha hai Ye dil diwana dub raha hai Matwale naino ke In nargisi ujalo me Aaja kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Aaja ki kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Kahna nahi tha kahna pada hai Pyar ka jadu aisa lada hai Mera dil na aa jaye  In pyar ki madbhari chalo me Aaja kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Aaja ki kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Ye mausam aaya hai kitane salo me Aaja kho jaye kwabo khayalo me Aaja ki kho jaye kwabo khayalo me
