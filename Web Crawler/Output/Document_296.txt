 (We are made for each other Suno ae jane jigar) - (2) Ke pahen ke sajugi me Garden ki sari palang Tere pyar me pehnunga Shuting be multi sanam  Hame bante diwana Dekhega zamana jane jana (We are made for each other Suno ae jane jigar) - (2)  (Dekh dekh dekh tujhko Mushku rayenge ha ha Colgate se phir hamare dant Cham chamayenge) - (2) Jab subhako milengi Hum mahekte phirenge Old spice ki mahek se (Niviya lagake hum Kya lagenge socho sanam) - (2)  Hame bante diwana Dekhega zamana jane jana (We are made for each other Suno ae jane jigar) - (2)  (Dhup me mai launga Umbrela sun brand Aur tujhe pilaungi thumsab Chal ke san and sen) - (2)  Tujhe bhukh jab lagengi Jarhona na fikar mannd Ke mai launga kahi se Tera amul shrikhand (Jo kabhi hoga jhukam Coldari kare gi kam) - (2)  Hame bante diwana Dekhega zamana jane jana (We are made for each other Suno ae jane jigar) - (2)  Ke pahen ke sajugi me Garden ki sari palang Tere pyar me pehnunga Shuting be multi sanam  Hame bante diwana Dekhega zamana jane jana (We are made for each other Suno ae jane jigar) - (2)
