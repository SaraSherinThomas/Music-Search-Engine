 He maine kasam lee, he tune kasam lee Nahee honge juda ham  Saans teree madir madir jaise rajanigandha Pyaar tera madhur madhur chandanee kee ganga Nahee honge juda ham  Paake kabhee khoya tujhe, khoke kabhee paaya Janam janam tere liye badalee hamne kaaya Nahee honge juda ham  Ek tan hai ek mann hai, ek praan apane Ek rang ek rup tere mere sapane Nahee honge juda ham
