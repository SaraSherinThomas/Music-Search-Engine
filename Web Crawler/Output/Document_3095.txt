 Aayegi aayegi aayegi kisi ko hamaari yaad aayegi  Mera mann kahata hai pyaase jeevan mein kabhi koi badali chhaayegi  Aayegi aayegi ...   Jo baat nikalati hai dil se kuch usaka asar hota hai  Kahane vaala to rota hai sunane vaala bhi rota hai  Fariyaad meri duniya ki deevaaron se takaraayegi  Aayegi aayegi ...   Duniya mein kaun hamaara hai  Kashti bhi hai tootee-phuuti aur kitani door kinaara hai  Maanjhi na sahi koi mauj kabhi saath hamein le jaayegi  Aayegi aayegi ...   In gam ki galiyon mein kab tak ye dard hamein tadapaayega  In raston pe chalate-chalate hamadard koi mil jaayega  Had hogi koi taqadeer yoon hi hamein kab tak thukaraayegi  Aayegi aayegi ...
