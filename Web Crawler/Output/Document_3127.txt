 Quiero volar Contigo esta noche Dejame gozar Este momento  (I want to fly With you this night You leave me to enjoy This night)  Kites in the sky Soaring together Lovers forever Forever is a lie  Whooo.... Holds the twine in his hand What has destiny planned Will the heart understand  Kites in the sky Soaring together Lovers forever Forever is a lie  Este amor Me esta matando Puedo *sentirme Como no tocarlo  (This love Is killing me I can feel it As not to touch it)  Quiero volar Contigo esta noche Dejame gozar Este momento  Kites in the sky mm mm hmm mm... Lovers forever mm hmm mm hmm...  Hmm mm mm mm mm....
