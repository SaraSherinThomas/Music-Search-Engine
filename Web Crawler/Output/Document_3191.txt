 (O manjhi -4, re jaye kaha) -2, kaha Naino me mere ghata ghanghor, sanso me uthe pavan kaa shor Aane wala hai re koyi tufan, o manjhi..........  Pyar o manjhi tera jhutha hai, mit banake tune luta hai Bhari dooniya me akeli hu, jan ghayal dil tuta hai Sujhe nahi aar par, laya kaha tera pyar, o manjhi..........  Too mera hai maine socha tha, yahi sapna tha nigaho me Too khiwaiya hoga re jivan kaa, par utarungi teree baho me Ek too hi tha mera, aur too bhi chal diya, o manjhi..........
