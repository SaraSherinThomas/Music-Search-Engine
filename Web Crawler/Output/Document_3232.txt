 Koyee aisa aalam banke aayee ho, jane kis duneeya kee tum parchayee ho Bhulee bisree yade sath mai layee ho, chhayee ho chhayee ho ham pe chhayee ho Koyee aisa alam banke aayee ho, koyee hakikat ho ya koyee saye ho Bhulee bisree yaade banke aaye ho, chahye ho chaye ho humpe chaye ho  Mai hu wahee wahee hai sama, pehle naa thee yeh shokhiya Mehakee huyee hai teree dhadkane, teree chahato mai ho gaye ham aaj gum Koyee aisa alam banke aayee ho, jane kis duneeya kee tum parchayee ho Bhulee bisree yaade sath mai layee ho, chhayee ho chhayee ho humpe chhayee ho  Kaise sahenge tere pyar kee judayee, kaise kahenge too hai harjayee Dekhe koyee meree bebasee, abb aag see lage jo gayee - (2) Koyee aisa alam banke aaye ho, koyee hakikat ho ya koyee saye ho Bhulee bisree yaade sath mai layee ho, chaye ho chaye ho humpe chaye ho Chhayee ho chhayee ho humpe chhayee ho, chhayee ho humpe chhayee ho
