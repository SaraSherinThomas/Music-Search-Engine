 Pyar dekar tune dee hai mujhko jindagee Too mila hai toh mile hai mujhko har khushee Tere najar me jab se lee hai panah iss dil me Tab se yu lagne laga  Sach huyee sach huyee me sach huyee Khwab thee tere liye me sach huyee  Koyee khayal thee ya parchhayee koyee Shayad sawal thee me dhundlayee koyee Tune mujhse pechana mujhse jana mujhe apna liya Mera matlab tune mujhe samjha diya  Sach huyee sach huyee me sach huyee Khwab thee tere liye me sach huyee  Koyee gila nahee abb toh nasib se Jana hai maine jo tujhko karib se Paya hai jo tujhko maine payliya hai khushiyo kaa jahan Teree najaro ne khud ko paliya yaha  Sach huyee sach huyee me sach huyee Khwab thee tere liye me sach huyee
