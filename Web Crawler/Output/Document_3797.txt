 Jiyara dhak dhak dhak bole, man mora khaye hichakole O baba what to do? o baba what to do? Kuchh kuchh ho raha hai mann me, ho na jaye kuchh divanepan me O baba what to do?  Jane hai kaisa nasha, jane hai kaisa asar Hay phisal rahee hai meree har najar Aise me too hee bata jaye koyee kidhar Aag jo idhar hai vahee hai udhar Lage nahee abb jiya tere bin Jiya jaye na piya tere bin, o baba what toh do?  Dekh jara mil ke aayine me dil ke Janejana teree hee tasvir hai Mere bhee hath kee yeh jo lakir hai Kah rahee hai too meree takadir hai Jane kab dil karar paye, too mile toh karar aaye O baba what toh do?
