 Teree meree ha meree teree, teree meree yaree badee puranee Tune mujhe pehchana, mai hu wahee teree divanee Ho ho janee janee janee, ho janee Teree meree ha meree teree, teree meree yaree badee puranee  Aankho ne dekha dil machal gaye, uff ham dono kitne badal gaye Kitne mausam aaye nikal gaye, uff ham dono kitne badal gaye Tune mujhe pehchana, mai hu wahee bhulee kahanee Ho ho janee janee janee, ho janee Teree meree ha meree teree, teree meree yaree badee puranee  Surat woh lekin woh najar nahee, dono pe kya gujaree kabar nahee Koyee shikwa kar lo magar nahee, dono pe kya gujaree kabar nahee Tune mujhe pehchana, mai hu wahee sapno kee ranee Ho ho janee janee janee, ho janee Teree meree meree teree, teree meree yaree badee puranee
