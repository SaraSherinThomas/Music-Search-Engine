 Jo dil pe gujarte hai wo gam yaad rahenge Ae duniya hume tere sitam yaad rahenge  Apna to hal ye hai jaha jane kharab me - 2 Dam jaise koi tod raha ho shabab me Apna to hal ye hai jaha jane kharab me  Dil ne khushi ka khwab dikhaya tha ek din - 2 Kismat ne gam diya hai tujhe jawab me Apna to hal ye hai jaha jane kharab me  (Aahe labo pe aankh me aansu Udas dil haye) - (2) Is zindgi ne dal diya kis adab me Apna to hal ye hai jaha jane kharab me Dam jaise koi tod raha ho shabab me Apna to hal ye hai jaha jane kharab me
