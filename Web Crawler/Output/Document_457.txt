 You know that i want love brother, so just play this queue I wanted to last forever, just leave it n repeat Nobody lives forever, lives give and take You just gotta find the love that compensates for faith  Love is going to set me free brother Whats tying you down right now The chains of loneliness brother I ve got used to them some how Nobody lives forever, lives give and take You just gotta find the love that compensates for faith  Dont you believe in soulmates brother They are for teenagers and swans to find And didnt you had a soulmate once brother Yeah but she committed suicide i m kidding Nobody lives forever, i guess, your lives give and take You just gotta find the love that compensates for faith
