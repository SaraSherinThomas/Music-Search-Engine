 Akeli hai zindagi, akela har lamha, hai tanha tanha mera dil - 2  Pyaaasa viraana hai sama, jalati hai raatein, bikhara hai dhuwaan Its burning, its burning, its burning..... Khaabon khayaalon ka jahaan, abb toh fanaa hai, na koi hai disha Its paining, its paining, its paining.....  Akeli hai zindagi, akela har lamha, hai tanha tanha mera dil  Koi na tera humsafar, kehati hai raahein tujhko hai pata I m lonely, i m lonely, i m lonely, i m so lonely Maana ki jakhmi hai jigar, tooti hai aahein, jo huwa so huwa Just ? it, just ? it.....  Akeli hai zindagi, akela har lamha, hai tanha tanha mera dil - 2
