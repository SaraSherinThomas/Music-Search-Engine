 Dekho ye righter hai bechara character hai Kismat me iski likha na chain ka chakkar hai Pyar ji wo woti hai akal ki wo khoti hai Pint house ka rag jap ute sadak pe le aayi hai Lekin phir bhi baba bole tu  Future to bright hai very very bright hai Rahu ketu mangal shani sabhi bole bright hai Future to bright hai very very bright hai Aage kuwa piche khai future to bright hai  Dory ke twist me don ke hist me Jan par ban aayi hai tune aag lagai hai Bauty ki buty me banda behal hai Yahi hai dastur hasino ne riyaste girai hai Lekin phir bhi baba bole tu  (Future to bright hai very very bright hai Rahu ketu mangal shani sabhi bole bright hai Future to bright hai very very bright hai Aage kuwa piche khai future to bright hai) - 2
