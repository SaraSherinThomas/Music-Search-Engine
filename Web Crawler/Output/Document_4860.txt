 Gopiyon sang ghoome kanhaiya Raas rachaiya radha na jaaye re Abb saanwra naa bhaaye re  (Radha on the dance floor Radha likes to party Radha likes to move that sexy radha party) - 2 Panghat pe aake saiyyan marode baiyaan And everybody crazy on radha Chedde humka daiyaan bairi kanhaiya And everybody crazy on radha Hoga woh lakhon dil ka chor Humka toh laage woh hua hai aise bawla jo kehta jaaye (O radha teri chunri O radha tera challa O radha teri natkhat najariya O radha tera jhumka O radha tera thumka O peechhe peechhe saari nagariya) - 2 Radha on the dance floor Radha likes to party Radha likes to move that sexy radha party  Maathe pe pankh more kehte hain makhan chor Bajaye bansuri bada aaya chitt-chor But radha wants more Dhoondungi charon aur milega koi aur Dungi me haathon me mere dil ki ye dor Cuz radha wants more O radha radha bholi deewani hai O radha radha do pal jawani hai O radha ko sambhalo koi isey bata do Ke milega na koi sanwariya O radha teri chunri O radha tera challa O radha teri natkhat najariya O radha tera jhumka O radha tera thumka O peechhe peechhe saari nagariya  Hey radha radha kaahe itna guroor pala Chhodo bhi nakhre ye kaisi ada Tune kya socha tu hi ek mashhoor yahaan Laakhon hain gopiyan bhi humpe fida Ho saari hi duniya ye naari hai Shuru humse teri kahaani hai O rehne de re kanha Bhoolega tu sataana Jo girungi main ban ke bijuria  Dafali wale dafali bajaa Mere ghoongaroo bulate hai tu aaa Main nachu tu nacha aa..  O radha teri chunri O radha tera challa O radha teri natkhat najariya O radha tera jhumka O radha tera thumka O peechhe peechhe saari nagariya (Radha on the dance floor Radha likes to party Radha likes to move that sexy radha party) - 3
