 Vada koyee pura nahee, yahee wafa hai kya Sachon me gum rehatee ho tum, yahee saja hai kya Nahee hai yeh pyar jana - (2)  Chehara haseen lekin teree jhuti hain yeh aankhe Kehatee ho kuchh karatee ho kuchh, kaise tumhe chahe Nahee hai yeh pyar jana - (2)  Dhadkan yeh jane teri hee mane, maine tumhe apna hee jana Samajhati ho tum mujhko divana, (nahee hai yeh pyar jana -2)  I shouldn'  t know better I shouldn'  t know better  Najarein kahee, dil hai kahee, banate ho begane Sab kuchh hai par, kuchh bhee nahee, tanha hain yeh rahe Dhadkan yeh jane, terihi mane, maine tumhe apna hee jana Samajhatee ho tum mujhko divana, (nahee hai yeh pyar jana - 6)
