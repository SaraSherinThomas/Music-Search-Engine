 O sajana, barakha bahaar aayee Ras kee puhaar layee, aakhiyo me pyaar laayee  Tumako pukaare mere mann kaa papihara Mithhee mithhee aganee me, jale mora jiyara  Aise rimjim me o sajan Pyaase pyaase mere nayan, tere hee khwaabo me kho gaye  Saawalee salonee ghata jab jab chhaayee Aakhiyo me raina gayee, nindiya naa aayee
