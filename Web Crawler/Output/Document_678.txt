 Look out look out the siren's blaring She drop it down i can't stop staring  Teri nazar to hai farebi Tera hua jaan-e-qaidi  She is burning like a fever And i'm a believer Nasha hai nazakate Inn aankho ke chodo Ada me karodo Chhupi hai shararate Its criminal baby booty going pop pop pop Its criminal baby party won't stop stop stop Its criminal that shorty driving me crazy Sexy like the girl should be Spending all my money on her  (Oh ishq asar kare dinna dinna Dil ka hashar kare dinna dinna Ek nazar kare dinna dinna Lakh dakatiya) - (2) Its criminal baby booty going pop pop pop  Nigahe aate jate nazare mere dekhe tham ke ho tham ke Ujale phaile mere adaye shishe jaise cham ke ho cham ke  O aadhi se zyada neendhe nakhre churaye Baki bachi jo teri zulfe udaye Tu hi bata de kaise khud ko bachaye Ye aankhe teri kare choriya  Its criminal baby booty going pop pop pop Its criminal baby party won't stop stop stop  (Oh ishq asar kare dinna dinna Dil ka hashar kare dinna dinna Ek nazar kare dinna dinna Lakh dakatiya) - (2)  Chori chori seenay se saanse Chori chori le gayi chura ke Chori chori khwabo me aake She got me loosin my mind  Chori chori aankho me aake Chori chori khaabo me jake Chori chori neende chura ke She got me loosin my mind  Look out look out the siren's blaring She drop it down i can't stop staring  Teri nazar to hai farebi Tera hua jaan-e-qaidi  Just might be a criminal She is burning like a fever And i'm a believer Nasha hai nazakate Inn aankho ke chodo Ada me karodo Chhupi hai shararate Its criminal baby booty going pop pop pop Its criminal baby party won't stop stop stop Its criminal that shorty driving me crazy Sexy like the girl should be Spending all my money on her  (Oh ishq asar kare dinna dinna Dil ka hashar kare dinna dinna Ek nazar kare dinna dinna Lakh dakatiya) - (2)
