 Dhuaa hai dhuaa zindagi Ek khwab jal gaya Tara jo chamaka tha kal Andhero me ghul gaya Raat andheri andheri rahi Ek subaha mili thi kahi kho gayi Baat adhuri adhuri rahi Me jahaa si chali thi Wahi hun khadi  Kya gazab ka ye khel khela Waqt ye kya kar gaya Khwab banke aaya tha tu Yaad banke reh gaya  In andheri galiyo ka ab Dikhata na koi sira Tut ke tu gir gaya Ek tu sitaara tha mera Roshani murjha gayi Ummide khumala gayi  Raat andheri andheri rahi Ek subaha mili thi kahi kho gayi Baat adhuri adhuri rahi Me jahaa si chali thi Wahi hun khadi  Kya gazab ka ye khel khela Waqt ye kya kar gaya Khwab banke aaya tha tu Yaad banke reh gaya
