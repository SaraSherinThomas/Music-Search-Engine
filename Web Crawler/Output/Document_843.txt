 Sitaaron ki shaan hai jo woh bachchan Cinema ka imaan hai jo Woh bachchan milon se dilon tak Aaya re aaya re chaaya re chaaya re Amitabh bachchan se milna hai  (Bacha bacha gaaye from bachpan bachpan Bachchan bachchan bachchan Woh hai bachchan bachchan) - 2 Naam hi superhit ki chaap hai Joh bhi hai yeh aaj apne aap hai Bhare padhe hai tamaam hero Rishtey mein yeh sabke baap hai Give it up for bachchan - 2  Saari duniya ka dil pighal gaya Jalwa mein inke woh taap hai Bhare padhe hai tamaam hero Rishtey mein yeh sabke baap hai Give it up for bachchan - 2  Aur bhia miley amitabh bachchan se Bacha bacha gaaye from bachpan bachpan Bachchan bachchan bachchan Woh hai bachchan bachchan Sitaaron ki shaan cinema ka imaan Aaya re aaya re chaaya re
