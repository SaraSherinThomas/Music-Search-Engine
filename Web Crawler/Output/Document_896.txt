 Ai meree jindagee, aaj raat jhum le, aasmaan ko chum le Kisko pata hai kal aaye ke na aaye, ai meree jindagee  Aaj hai duneeya teree jhum le o matvaale Yeh anamol jamaane phir nahee aane vaale Dekh yeh rut kahee bit naa jaaye, ai meree jindagee  Pal pal katatee jaaye saans kee naajuk doree Jalate kanval bujhaaye maut kee sina joree Agale hee pal jaane kya ho jaaye Ai meree jindagee  Aaj thahar hee na jaaye dhalatee raat ke saaye Kal kisne dekha hai aaye ya na aaye Aaye bhee toh jaane hame paaye ke na paaye Ai meree jindagee
