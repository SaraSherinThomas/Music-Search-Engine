 Ho dance not coming courtyaard crooked Eating cake by being stupeed Buffalo going in the water Gayi bhens paani mein If you tiger me tiger encounter - 2 Im feeling alright cause its a nonsense ki night - 4  Oh monkey hata o flavour of ginger arey flavour of ginger In the jungle peacock is dancing who has in her Whose is stick his is buffalo - 3 But remember hundred of goldsmiths equals one of blacksmith Im feeling alright cause its a nonsense ki night - 4  Clouds that make noise dont rain - 2 Staying in water dont be enemy of crocodile - 3 why Im feeling alright cause its a nonsense ki night - 4 All is in the well if end is in the well - 4 Ho baaki duniya go to hello
